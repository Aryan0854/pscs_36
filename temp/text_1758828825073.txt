Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in opportunities within your organization where I can contribute my skills as a web developer and AI/ML enthusiast. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Presidency University, Bangalore.

Through a series of academic projects, internships, and personal initiatives, I have gained practical experience in full-stack web development using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python (Flask), Node.js, and MySQL. I have also worked on AI-integrated applications, including a license plate recognition system using computer vision, and a medical plant identification tool using machine learning.

Beyond technical capabilities, I bring a strong work ethic, adaptability, and the ability to collaborate effectively in diverse teams. My experiences with NGOs and startups have taught me to build solutions that are not just functional, but impactful and user-centric.

I am enthusiastic about joining a team where I can grow, contribute meaningfully, and apply my technical skills to solve real-world problems. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can support your goals and initiatives.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,Aryan Mishraseema.aryan.arnav@gmail.com | +91 9650087025
