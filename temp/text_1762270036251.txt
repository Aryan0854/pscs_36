Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in opportunities within your organization where I can contribute my skills in software development, data analytics, and AI/ML applications. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Presidency University, Bangalore.

My background combines full-stack development and AI/ML expertise. I have built and deployed projects ranging from web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python (Flask), and Node.js, to data-driven systems such as a license plate recognition tool leveraging computer vision and a medicinal plant identification model using machine learning. I am also skilled with SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel, enabling me to bridge the gap between software engineering and data analysis.

Beyond my technical skills, I bring adaptability, teamwork, and a user-centric mindset. Through internships, NGO collaborations, and hackathons, I have learned to design solutions that are not only functional but also impactful, scalable, and meaningful for real-world users. My certifications from Accenture, Tata, and Google further reinforce my commitment to continuous learning and staying current with industry standards.

I am excited about the possibility of contributing to your team, bringing both my technical expertise and problem-solving approach to support your initiatives. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss how my skills can align with your organizational goals.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,Aryan Mishra📧 seema.aryan.arnav@gmail.com | 📱 +91 9650087025
